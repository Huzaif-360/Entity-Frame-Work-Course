     * Table Names:
     * Plular form of class names
     * 
     * for example:
     *  class name = course:
     *  then table name sould be courses
     *  
     *  If name of the table is different that we should mention it seperately and if it is existing in another schema that we should write the name of the schema also.
     *  
     *  
     *  Name of Columns:
     *  Name
     *  ID
     *  Color
     *  Class ect........
     *  
     *  Same is the case with column as we use with the table name.
     *  If name of the column is different that we should mention it seperately and if it is existing in another schema that we should write the name of the schema also.
     *  
     *  
     *  Primary Key:
     *  A property Name ID or ClassName ID
