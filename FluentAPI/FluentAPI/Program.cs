/*Completed section 6 
 * Querying Data using LINQ
 * Completed Lecture 46
 * 
 * LINQ:
 * What is LINQ
 * Language Integrated Query:
 * It is a model which is used to get the data using query.
 * 
 * List of objects can be queried by the LINQ
 * 
 *LINQ:
 * Using LINQ we can query:
 * Objects
 * XML
 * Relational DataBases
 * NoSQL DataBases
 * 
 * 
 * ....................................................
 * WHat Before LINK:
 * we had to use complete model to query objects.
 * models:
 *  1. SQL Server Model and we used T-SQL queries to work.
 *  2. Oracle Server Model and we used PS/SQL queries to work.
 *  3. XML Server Model and we used XQuery queries to work.
 *
 *
 *  ....................................................
 *  After LINQ:
 *  We use C# code and the model remains the same.
 *  Now with linQ we use the exact same model to create any data source at runtime depending on what the 
 *  target data stories are queries will be automatically translated into a different language that is supported by that data store.
 *  
 *  ....................................................
 *  Benifits of LINQ
 *  No more SQL queries/ stored procedures.
 *  Increased Productivity.
 *  LINK us for simple queries.
 *  FOR big or complex queries use other model.
